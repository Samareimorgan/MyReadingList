## MyReadingList
### A node &amp; mysql MVC/ORM application 

## About
My Reading List aka The Reading Rover is a simple mysql and node based application. The premise is an app that allows the user to enter text (in this instance a book title) and that text goes to the left side of the page.  These are books that are yet to be read.  Once the user has read the book, they press the "READ IT" button next to the book and it moves to the right hand side of the page.  This allows the user to note how many books they have read.   If at any time the user would like to delete the book, they can once the book is on the right hand side of the page by pressing the delete button.
